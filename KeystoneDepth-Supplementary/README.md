The suplementary materials contain three files:

- `_OPEN_ME.html` is the main page of videos results including demo of the KeystoneAR app, comparison with Stereo Magnification and examples for categories "very few artifacts", "some artifacts" and "failure". It is necessary to appreciate the results as videos. Be sure to check it out.

- `app.html` shows demo of the KeystoneAR app.

- `supplementary.pdf` shows the ablation study results and describe the algorithm to compute boundary maps.

Recommend to use *Firefox*/Chrome/Safari.

If any video does not play, please close other applications or restart the computer to free up more memory. You can also directly go into the folder to view the videos.
