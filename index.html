												<h2>Introduction</h2>
											</header>
											<p>Isn't it cumbersome to grab your cell phone to look at instructions while you are cooking some oily food? Isn't it tedious to repetitively capture, upload and edit your tutorials?
											In this project, we want to demonstrate Hololens's abilities in easing both tutorial authoring and consumption process.
											So we will build two apps, a general turotial authoring app that helps users generate any kind of tutorials and a cooking tutorial consumption app that guides a user through one recipe as proof-of-concept. We name this app, "HoloCooking".</p>

											<h3>HoloCooking</h3>
											<p>It's always curbersome to touch your cell phone to go through instructions while cooking some oily food. And you always need to stop your work to check the instructions and then pause it to go back to work. When watching a generic tutorial video, we would have to constantly navigate the content, pause and restart the video, in order to learn how to cook a recipe. 
											Our "HoloCooking" will free you from these burdens and lead you to a hands-free interactive cooking tutorial. We plan to create a proof-of-concept application that guides you through cooking one recipe, but have longer plan to expand this to support multiple recipes in the future.
											"HoloCooking" utilizes the revolutionary features of Hololens, such as but not limited to good tracking, spatial sound, voice recognition, and more.</p>
											<h3>How-to</h3>
											<p>
											How-To is a platform that makes creating effective tutorials for the HoloLens easy. This is accomplished by using the HoloLens for content creation. The HoloLens captures point-of-view video, which naturally requires instructors to include the motions and perspectives viewers need to put themselves in the place of the instructor and reproduce their actions. While capturing video, the field of view is visible so instructors can easily compose shots hands free. Holograms used for instruction are also recorded. The provided speech recognition and spatial information, can be used to name places and tutorial steps. This can be used for tutorial navigation and locating the viewerâ€™s videos. Instructors get real time feedback so mistakes can be addressed immediately. Additional features such as some very basic editing tools may be added. Videos could be shortened by either cutting or speed up, and step indicators added or removed. We will foster a growing knowledge base around physical interactions.

											<h2> Project Details and Features</h2>
											</header>
											<p>
												<b>Overview and Preparation Stage</b> The user is shown the steps for the recipe with very brief descriptions along with the ingredients needed in each steps so that the user can see the big picture of the process. Then, the user will be given options to change some of the ingredients (e.g. pork to chicken), or skip a step depending on his need. The user will also be given his dietary preferences such as amount of calories, sodium, spiciness, or fat he wants to consume. The rest of the guide will be modified according to this option changes.
											</p>
											<p>
												<b>Location Registration</b> The user will drag and drop the necessary locations such as sink, oven, stove, microwave in his own kitchen. These locations will later be used such as having alarm clock on top of stove, showing next step on top of cutting board, etc.
											</p>
											<p>
												<b>Steps and Features</b> Each step within the process is considered like a thread. Some threads can be done in parellel while others can not. When a user needs to start a step, he will be notified to start a step such as boiling water. This notification will make sound and appear on top of the location that it needs to be done, e.g. stove. Then a step can be waiting, or done like a thread. (an alarm might be used to notify the user when waiting is finished). At each step, user can request a short video showing and explaining how a step should be done (such as chopping an onion). When there is danger such as hot water, a warning sign will appear. Other features include checklist, step reverse and fast-forward, sharing, and more!
